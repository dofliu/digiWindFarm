- [x] 97 SCADA tags total (was 96): +1 yaw-induced wake deflection tag (`WMET_WakeDefl`)
- [x] Atmospheric stability / diurnal shear-TI coupling (continuous score s=solar·wind_damping·cloud_damping, α=0.14−0.10·s clamped [0.04, 0.30], TI_mult=1+0.5·s clamped [0.5, 1.6], strong-wind mechanical mixing, override-neutral, per-turbine α offset renamed) — see #99

- [x] 101 SCADA tags total (was 100): +1 wake-added TI tag (`WMET_WakeTi`)
- [x] Dynamic atmospheric pressure P(t) (synoptic `_pressure_state` ∈ [−1, +1] scaled to ±1500 Pa around 101325 Pa; fed through `get_air_density` so ρ gains another ±1.5% frontal swing on top of T/RH; override rejects to ISA reference) — see #106
- [x] 102 SCADA tags total (was 101): +1 ambient pressure tag (`WMET_AmbPressure`)
- [x] Atmospheric-stability × Bastankhah wake-expansion coupling (k* = k_neutral · clamp(1 + 0.30·s, 0.55, 1.45); stable ABL → longer wake, convective ABL → shorter wake; no new tag, observable via `WMET_WakeDef × WMET_AtmStab`) — see #109
- [x] Removed duplicate `get_wake_added_ti` definition in `PerTurbineWind` (F811 fix after #103/#106 merge) — see #108
- [x] Atmospheric-stability × wind veer coupling (#111): `veer_rate_eff = veer_base · clamp(1 − s, 0.3, 2.5)` (Holton/Stull/van der Laan 2017); stable ABL preserves Ekman spiral (~0.20 °/m, +37% TwrSS), convective ABL mixes it out (~0.03 °/m, −26%); per-turbine `wind_veer_rate` retained as site variance; effective rate flows to both aero power-loss and fatigue load paths; no new SCADA tag — see #111
- [x] Atmospheric-stability × wake meander timescale τ_m coupling (#113): `τ_m_eff = 25 · clamp(1 − 0.6·s, 0.4, 2.0)` s (Counihan 1975 / Larsen DWM 2008 / Peña & Hahmann 2012); stable ABL → 40 s slow meander, neutral → 25 s, convective → 10 s fast turnover; lag-25 s autocorrelation 0.45 vs 0.28 vs 0.01; σ_θ amplitude path stays 0.3·TI (owned by #99 TI mult) so only the timescale path is added; 102 SCADA physics tags unchanged — observable via `WMET_WakeMndr × WMET_AtmStab` autocorrelation — see #113
- [x] Atmospheric-stability × turbulence integral length scale L_u coupling (#115): `L_u_eff = 340 · clamp(1 − 0.6·s, 0.4, 2.0)` m (Counihan 1975 / Kaimal & Finnigan 1994 / Peña & Hahmann 2012 / IEC 61400-1 ed.4 Annex C); stable nocturnal ABL → L_u=544 m / τ≈54 s @ 10 m/s, neutral → 340 m / 34 s, convective afternoon → 136 m / 14 s; validated lag-30 s autocorr 0.574 / 0.401 / 0.097 (stable / neutral / convective) vs analytical 0.576 / 0.414 / 0.110; σ_v amplitude unchanged (owned by #99 TI mult); applied to both farm-wide `_turbulence_gen` and per-turbine `_turb_gens[i]`; 102 SCADA physics tags unchanged — observable via `WMET_AtmStab × WROT_RotSpd` low-frequency autocorrelation — see #115
- [x] Nacelle anemometer transfer function (#117, IEC 61400-12-1 Annex D): real cup/sonic anemometer sits ~1.5R behind hub on top of nacelle, reads systematically below free-stream because of axial induction. NTF formula `V_raw = V_∞ · (1 − k_pos·a)` with `a = 0.5·(1 − √(1 − Ct))` (1-D momentum theory) and `k_pos = 0.55` (anemometer position weight). Operating-state branching: stopped/parked uses bluff-body speed-up `1.04·V_∞`; producing/starting with `rotor_speed > 1 RPM` applies the induction reduction. Self-test (7/7 + monotonicity): Region 2 (Ct=0.82) → 0.84·V_∞; Region 3 (Ct=0.30) → 0.96·V_∞; stopped → 1.04·V_∞; clamped to [0.78, 1.10]. Reuses `aero_out.ct` already computed in `step()` (no extra cost, no new RNG mutation). Backwards compatible: existing `WMET_WSpeedNac` keeps free-stream semantics so `examples/data_quality_analysis.py` and OPC adapter consumers still get the same number; new `WMET_WSpeedRaw` exposes the as-measured anemometer reading (Bachmann OPC suffix `WMET.Z72PLC__UI_Loc_WMET_Analogue_WSpeedRaw`). 103 SCADA tags total (was 102): +1 raw nacelle anemometer tag (`WMET_WSpeedRaw`).
- [x] 103 SCADA tags total (was 102): +1 raw nacelle anemometer tag (`WMET_WSpeedRaw`) — see #117
- [x] Nacelle wind vane transfer function (#119, IEC 61400-12-2 Annex E): completes the IEC 61400-12-1/2 nacelle sensor pair started by #117. Real wind vane mounted alongside the anemometer reads systematic swirl bias from rotor wake (angular-momentum conservation). Closed form `θ_s ≈ Ct/(2·λ) [rad]` (Burton et al. 2011 *Wind Energy Handbook* §3.7). Right-handed rotor → +bias on downstream vane. Reuses `aero_out.ct` and `aero_out.tsr` already computed by `power_curve.get_power_cp(...)`, so zero extra cost and no new RNG mutation. Operating-state branching: producing/starting AND `rotor_speed > 1 RPM` AND `tsr > 1` applies bias; otherwise 0°. Final clamp `±8°` (Pedersen et al. 2008 Risø-R-1602 reports field bias 3–8°). 360° wrap-around handled. Self-test (8/8 + Ct↑→bias↑ + λ↑→bias↓ monotonicity): Region 2 (Ct≈0.82, λ≈7) → +3.36°; Region 2.5 → +3.10°; Region 3 (Ct≈0.30, λ≈5) → +1.72°; starting → +2.63°; stopped → 0°; extreme Ct=0.95/λ=2 clamps at +8°. Backwards compatible: `WMET_WDirAbs` keeps free-stream direction so wake-model upstream indexing, `yaw_model.py` controller, frontend wind rose, and OPC adapters are unchanged; new `WMET_WDirRaw` (REAL32, °, 0–360) exposes the as-measured vane reading. Downstream applications: IEC 61400-12-2 nacelle power-curve studies, vane-miscalibration fault simulation, `WMET_WDirRaw - yaw_angle` as systematic-yaw-bias diagnostic channel. 104 SCADA tags total (was 103): +1 raw nacelle wind vane tag (`WMET_WDirRaw`).
- [x] 104 SCADA tags total (was 103): +1 raw nacelle wind vane tag (`WMET_WDirRaw`) — see #119

## Known Issues / Next Improvements

### Physics Realism (from data quality analysis)

- [x] Wind shear profile: power-law V(h) with azimuth-dependent blade loading, 1P torque modulation — see #71
- [x] Blade mass imbalance: per-turbine blade mass offsets, centrifugal force F=Δm×r_cg×ω², 1P vibration + load coupling — see #72
- [x] Gearbox oil temperature/viscosity: Walther equation, cold-start efficiency loss, overheat degradation — see #73
- [x] Ambient humidity effect on air cooling: moist-air density factor + dew-point condensation penalty, seasonal/diurnal humidity profile — see #89
- [x] Localized turbulence pockets: Gaussian spatial pockets with stochastic spawn (~1 per 10–15 min), per-turbine TI multiplier boost, exposed via `WMET_LocalTi` — see #91
- [x] Wake model upgrade: Bastankhah-Porté-Agel Gaussian wake (replaces simplified Jensen top-hat); TI-dependent expansion, Ct-coupled deficit, sum-of-squares multi-wake superposition, exposed via `WMET_WakeDef` — see #93
- [x] Dynamic wake meandering: Larsen-DWM AR(1) lateral oscillation applied per source (σ_θ=0.3·TI, τ=25 s), downstream `WMET_WakeDef` now has realistic time variability, new `WMET_WakeMndr` tag — see #95
- [x] Yaw-induced wake deflection: Bastankhah 2016 initial skew θ_c=0.3·γ·(1−√(1−Ct·cos γ))/cos γ, δ_y(x)=tan(θ_c)·x coupled per-source; engine feeds per-turbine yaw_error back each step; new `WMET_WakeDefl` tag — see #97
- [x] Atmospheric stability / diurnal shear-TI coupling: Monin-Obukhov-simplified continuous score s ∈ [−1, +1] from solar time × mechanical mixing × cloud damping; drives α (0.04–0.30) and TI multiplier (0.5–1.6); new `WMET_ShearAlpha` + `WMET_AtmStab` tags — see #99
- [x] Air density coupling: ρ(T, RH) = P/(R_d·T) · (1 − 0.378·e/P) with Magnus vapor pressure; fed per-step into `PowerCurveModel.air_density`; power and thrust vary ±10% between cold-dry and hot-humid conditions; new `WMET_AirDensity` tag — see #101
- [x] Wake-added turbulence intensity (Crespo-Hernández 1996): TI_w = 0.73·a^0.8325·TI_∞^0.0325·(x/D)^-0.32 with a = 0.5·(1−√(1−Ct)), near-field capped at x/D=5; shared Bastankhah σ for Gaussian radial decay (no new parameter); Frandsen sum-of-squares across upstream sources; combined with pocket TI (#91) in quadrature before AR(1) generator so downstream σ_v observably rises (+36% at T1 in 3-in-line self-test); new `WMET_WakeTi` tag — see #103
- [x] Dynamic atmospheric pressure P(t): `_pressure_state ∈ [−1, +1]` → `P(t) = 101325 + s·1500 Pa` (mid-latitude ±15 hPa amplitude); fed into `get_air_density(ts, ..., pressure_pa=...)`, so ρ gains another ±1.5% time variability from synoptic weather fronts on top of #101's T/RH coupling; manual override locks P at ISA reference; new `WMET_AmbPressure` tag (hPa) — see #106
- [x] Atmospheric-stability × wake-expansion coupling: Bastankhah k* modulated by the existing #99 continuous stability score s; `k* = k_neutral · clamp(1 + 0.30·s, 0.55, 1.45)`, clamp [0.015, 0.08]. Stable ABL (s<0) slows wake recovery (longer wake, larger deficit at same spacing); convective ABL (s>0) speeds it up. At V=10 m/s, TI=8%, 6 D downstream: stable s=−1 ≈ +34% deficit vs neutral; convective s=+1 ≈ −22%. No new SCADA tag — observable via `WMET_WakeDef × WMET_AtmStab` correlation (expected r < −0.4 at downstream turbines during diurnal cycling) — see #109
- [x] Atmospheric-stability × wind-veer coupling: per-turbine `wind_veer_rate` (#79) is now multiplied by `clamp(1 − s, 0.3, 2.5)` driven by the same #99 continuous stability score s. Stable ABL (s<0) preserves the Ekman spiral → strong veer (~0.20 °/m at s=−1) → +37% tower side-side moment, −13 kW power loss vs neutral; convective ABL (s>0) mixes it out → weak veer (~0.03 °/m at s=+1) → −26% TwrSS. Per-turbine `wind_veer_rate` retained as site/manufacturing variance on top of atmospheric trend. Effective rate flows into both `turbine_physics`'s aero power-loss block (azimuth-dependent equivalent yaw error) and `fatigue_model.step(wind_veer_rate=...)` so structural loads and aero power stay consistent. No new SCADA tag — observable via `WMET_AtmStab × WLOD_TwrSsMom` correlation — see #111
- [x] Atmospheric-stability × wake-meander timescale coupling (#113): the Larsen-DWM AR(1) integral timescale (#95) `τ_m = 25 s` is now stability-dependent: `τ_m_eff = 25 · clamp(1 − 0.6·s, 0.4, 2.0)` s, driven by the same #99 score s. Stable ABL (s<0, suppressed vertical mixing, larger atmospheric integral length scale L_u) → τ_m=40 s (slow, persistent meander); neutral (s=0) → 25 s baseline; convective ABL (s>0, vigorous overturning, shorter L_u) → τ_m=10 s (fast turnover). σ_θ amplitude path is unchanged at 0.3·TI — the amplitude per-stability response is already carried by #99's TI multiplier (0.5–1.6×), so this adds the orthogonal timescale path only. Validation on a 4000 s AR(1) sequence (TI=0.10): lag-25 s autocorrelation 0.45 (stable) / 0.28 (neutral) / 0.01 (convective); zero-crossing rate 0.082 / 0.098 / 0.140 — confirming slower meander under stable conditions and faster turnover under convection. Implementation is a 6-line change in `_update_wake_meander` reusing the `atm_stability` already passed through `PerTurbineWind.step(...)` for #109. No new SCADA tag — observable via `WMET_WakeMndr × WMET_AtmStab` autocorrelation. References: Counihan (1975) *Atmos. Environ.* 9, 871–905; Larsen et al. (2008) *Wind Energy* 11, 289–301; Peña & Hahmann (2012) *Wind Energy* 15, 717–731; IEC 61400-1 ed.4 Annex C — see #113
- [x] Atmospheric-stability × turbulence integral length scale L_u coupling (#115): the Kaimal-style AR(1) integral length scale `L_u = 340 m` (IEC 61400-1 ed.4 hub-height neutral baseline) is now stability-dependent: `L_u_eff = 340 · clamp(1 − 0.6·s, 0.4, 2.0)` m, driven by the same #99 score s. Mapping (V=10 m/s): s=−1 (stable, suppressed mixing, elongated streamwise eddies) → L_u=544 m, τ≈54 s; s=0 (neutral) → 340 m, 34 s; s=+1 (convective, vigorous overturning, broken-up eddies) → 136 m, 14 s. σ_v amplitude path is unchanged at TI·V — the amplitude per-stability response is already carried by #99's TI multiplier (0.5–1.6×), so this adds the orthogonal timescale path only, exactly parallel to #113 for wake meander. Validation on a 4000 s AR(1) sequence (TI=0.10, V=10 m/s): lag-30 s autocorrelation 0.574 (stable) / 0.401 (neutral) / 0.097 (convective) vs analytical exp(−30/τ) = 0.576 / 0.414 / 0.110 — within 1.4 / 3.1 / 1.3 % of the closed form; steady-state σ_v measured at 0.99 / 0.98 / 0.99 m/s vs expected 1.00 — amplitude unchanged. Same s passed to both `_turbulence_gen` (farm base wind in `engine.py`) and every `_turb_gens[i].step(...)` (per-turbine spatial decorrelation in `PerTurbineWind.step`), so the whole farm shares one ABL timescale. No new SCADA tag — observable via `WMET_AtmStab × WROT_RotSpd` low-frequency autocorrelation, plus indirect lift to low-frequency `WLOD_TwrFaMom` content on stable nights.
